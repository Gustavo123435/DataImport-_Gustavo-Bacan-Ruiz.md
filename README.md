## I am going to write the different about data import definition. 

* Definition the data table concept:
  * Data is complex, and all data is different. Accordingly, DataTables has a wealth of options which can be used to configure how it will obtain the data to display in the table, and how it processes that data.
* Definition the data types:
  * Categorial: *categorical data is a collection of information that is divided into groups. I.e, if an organisation or agency is trying to get a biodata of its employees, the                     resulting data is referred to as categorical. This data is called categorical because it may be grouped according to the variables present in the biodata                         such as sex, state of residence, etc.*
                **Categorical data can take on numerical values (such as “1” indicating Yes and “2” indicating No), but those numbers don’t have mathematical meaning. One can                       neither add them together nor subtract them from each other.** 
   * Numerical: *Numerical data is a data type expressed in numbers, rather than natural language description. Sometimes called quantitative data,numerical data is always                          collected in number form*. **Numerical data differentiates itself with other number form data types with its ability to carry out arithmetic operations with                      these numbers.**
   * Boolean: *BOOLEAN can be used as a data type when defining a column in a table or a variable in a database procedure. Support for the BOOLEAN data type helps migrations                   from other database products.*
              **Boolean columns accept as input the SQL literals FALSE and TRUE. In addition, due to automatic coercion rules, the strings 'FALSE' and 'TRUE' and the integers 0                 and 1 are also acceptable for use in a Boolean column or variable. Input is not case sensitive.**
              **The IS Boolean operator can be used in expressions. IS TRUE is true for a BOOLEAN TRUE, IS FALSE is true for a BOOLEAN FALSE, IS UNKNOWN is true for an Unknown                   (NULL) value. IS UNKNOWN is a synonym for IS NULL when dealing with Boolean values.**
              **ORDER BY BOOLEAN results in grouping rows in this order: FALSE, TRUE, NULL.**
              **The CREATE INDEX statement allows an index to be created on BOOLEAN columns.**
              **Terminal Monitor output for a BOOLEAN column shows the literals FALSE and TRUE as unquoted strings**
 * The common data: 
    * CSV: *CSV (comma separated values) files are used to store tabular data in plain text format. Most often the fields in this data are separated by commas but                              other delimiters can be used such as |. TSV (tab separated values) files are similar but breaks are delimited by tabs. Both formats are widely supported                            and are often used to exchange data across multiple different computers and systems that support the format.*

               **Most modern spreadsheet packages can open CSV/TSV files for viewing. To maintain formatting data you will want to save in a proprietary format like XLS                            (Microsoft Office Excel), ODS (Open Office spreadsheets) or .numbers (Apple Mac), depending on the software you use. A free tool for viewing csv and                              other spreadsheet formats online can be found here.**
    * Json : *Json (javascript object notation) files are human-readable text files used to transport data in key/value pairs. It is a format widely used on the web and is often              the type of data returned from an API call.*

                         *Whilst human readable, json is generally used by software as a data source. A useful free tool to view json in interesting ways can be found here.*
