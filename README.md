## I am going to write the different about data import definition. 

* Definition the data table concept:
  * Data is complex, and all data is different. Accordingly, DataTables has a wealth of options which can be used to configure how it will obtain the data to display in the table, and how it processes that data.
* Definition the data types:
  * Categorial: *categorical data is a collection of information that is divided into groups. I.e, if an organisation or agency is trying to get a biodata of its employees, the                     resulting data is referred to as categorical. This data is called categorical because it may be grouped according to the variables present in the biodata such as                   sex, state of residence, etc.*
                **Categorical data can take on numerical values (such as “1” indicating Yes and “2” indicating No), but those numbers don’t have mathematical meaning. One can                       neither add them together nor subtract them from each other.** 
   * Numerical: *Numerical data is a data type expressed in numbers, rather than natural language description. Sometimes called quantitative data,numerical data is always                          collected in number form*. **Numerical data differentiates itself with other number form data types with its ability to carry out arithmetic operations with these                  numbers.**
   * Boolean: *BOOLEAN can be used as a data type when defining a column in a table or a variable in a database procedure. Support for the BOOLEAN data type helps migrations from               other database products.*
              **Boolean columns accept as input the SQL literals FALSE and TRUE. In addition, due to automatic coercion rules, the strings 'FALSE' and 'TRUE' and the integers 0                 and 1 are also acceptable for use in a Boolean column or variable. Input is not case sensitive.**
              **The IS Boolean operator can be used in expressions. IS TRUE is true for a BOOLEAN TRUE, IS FALSE is true for a BOOLEAN FALSE, IS UNKNOWN is true for an Unknown                   (NULL) value. IS UNKNOWN is a synonym for IS NULL when dealing with Boolean values.**
              **ORDER BY BOOLEAN results in grouping rows in this order: FALSE, TRUE, NULL.**
              **The CREATE INDEX statement allows an index to be created on BOOLEAN columns.**
              **Terminal Monitor output for a BOOLEAN column shows the literals FALSE and TRUE as unquoted strings**
