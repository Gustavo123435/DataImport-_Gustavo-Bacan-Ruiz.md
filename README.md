## I am going to write the different about data import definition. 

* Definition the data table concept:
  * Data is complex, and all data is different. Accordingly, DataTables has a wealth of options which can be used to configure how it will obtain the data to display in the table, and how it processes that data.
* Definition the data types:
  * categorial: Categorical data is a collection of information that is divided into groups. I.e, if an organisation or agency is trying to get a biodata of its employees, the                     resulting data is referred to as categorical. This data is called categorical because it may be grouped according to the variables present in the biodata such as                   sex, state of residence, etc.
                Categorical data can take on numerical values (such as “1” indicating Yes and “2” indicating No), but those numbers don’t have mathematical meaning. One can                       neither add them together nor subtract them from each other.
